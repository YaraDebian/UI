# UI

This project displays in a grid the contacts. It allows the user to create, update and delete a contact. It adds the ability to view the editing history for each contact as well. 
## Development server
run npm install to install all dependencies.
Run `ng serve` or `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Next steps
Add routing between templates (if more are added).

Use Dev-Extreme packages for a better functional user experience.

Add login page and handle the login request from the backend.
